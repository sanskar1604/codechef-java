# Largest Common Element in Two Arrays

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of positive integers, `arr1` and `arr2`, of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.  

Your task is to **find the largest common element** that appears in both arrays. If no common element exists, return `-1`.

---

## 🧾 Input Format

1. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` — the sizes of the two arrays.
2. The second line contains `n` space-separated integers — elements of `arr1`.
3. The third line contains `m` space-separated integers — elements of `arr2`.

---

## 📤 Output Format

- A single integer — the **largest common element**.  
- If there is no common element, print `-1`.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 10^9`
